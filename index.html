      <!--  <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a 
motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking 
trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You
 spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some
 motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will 
never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that 
shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed 
facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 
100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background 
color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so 
you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You 
piece of shit.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be 
responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever 
motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if 
you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It fucking works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can 
read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's
 using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's
 in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three 
bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full
 screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the 
jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what
 his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. 
All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what 
should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked 
website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like 
this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are
 <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
